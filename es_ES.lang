//gui stuff
/*
*   The first part of it shows its a gui eg: gui.guiEvolve.huh.
*   The second part shows where it goes to in very short eg:
*   guiEvolve goes to the evolve gui and guiItemDrops goes to
*   the boss drop and trainer drop guis.
*   The last part refers simply to their meaning in the gui.
*   eg: gui.trading.trade has trade at the end because
*   the text it displays would be trade. It isnt always like that.
*   For instance gui.guiEvolve.done doesnt say done it says
*   Your $p evolved into a $n
*
*
*   In here you will notice some symbols like $p and $n.
*   $p refers to your pixelmon or a pixelmon in general when
*   there is only one being referenced in that line.
*   $n is the other pixelmon.
*   $d is the other player.
*   $a was a one time occurance which stands for enabled or disabled.

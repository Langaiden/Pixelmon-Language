*   Hello, and thanks for looking at the lang! If you are here to
*   translate it there are little tidbits above each section to
*   reference, but it's VERY straightforward. To translate the mod
*   all you need to do is replace the text after the "=" to what you
*   desire! It's that simple!
*/

//Items
/*
*   item stands for "it is an item", just like in item.PC.name.
*   The middle one stands for its name as defined by code.
*   The final part is just saying it is the name of the item.

//GUI stuff
/*
*   The first part of it shows it's a GUI, e.g., "gui.guiEvolve.huh".
*   The second part shows where it goes to, e.g.,
*   "guiEvolve" goes to the evolve GUI and "guiItemDrops" goes to
*   the boss drop and Trainer drop GUIs.
*   The last part refers simply to its meaning in the GUI.
*   E.g., "gui.trading.trade" has "trade" at the end because
*   the text it displays would be trade. It isn't always like that.
*   For instance "gui.guiEvolve.done" doesn't say done; it says
*   "Your $p evolved into a $n"
*
*
*   In here you will notice some symbols like $p and $n.
*   "$p" refers to your Pokémon or a Pokémon in general when
*   there is only one being referenced in that line.
*   "$n" is the other Pokémon.
*   "$d" is the other player.
*   "$a" was a one time occurrence which stands for enabled or disabled
*   depending on what instance to call on.
